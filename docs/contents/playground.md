# SQL Playground

> N-SQL supports the translation of sql equivalent into SQL statements of several databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, sqlserver, sqlite. (The current support is not comprehensive enough)

You can visit [here](/playground/) and write some sql that are currently supported by N-SQL, then ckick the button to translate into the corresponding database,and then look at the online database SQL test site to see if it can run correctly.

Currently only these online test sites are collected, if there is a better welcome recommendation.
